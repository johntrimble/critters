# Critters
This is based on a clever programming assignment developed by [Stuart Reges](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~reges/). The original was written in Java, and I've rewritten it from scratch in Clojure mainly for practice.

## Requirements
- Tested with Leiningen 2.2.0

## Running

```
git clone https://github.com/johntrimble/critters.git
cd critters
lein run -m critters.main
```
